This results in a *huge* speedup - up to 100X! The downside of XLA generation, though, is that it doesn't like variable input shapes, because it needs to run a new compilation for each new input shape! To compensate for that, let's use `pad_to_multiple_of` for the dataset we use for text generation. This will reduce the number of unique input shapes a lot, meaning we can get the benefits of XLA generation with only a few compilations."
