Note that our data collators are designed to work for multiple frameworks, so ensure you set the `return_tensors='np'` argument to get NumPy arrays out - you don't want to accidentally get a load of `torch.Tensor` objects in the middle of your nice TF code! You could also use `return_tensors='tf'` to get TensorFlow tensors, but our TF dataset pipeline actually uses a NumPy loader internally, which is wrapped at the end with a `tf.data.Dataset`. As a result, `np` is usually more reliable and performant when you're using it!"

There are two ways to do this - we can use the slightly more low-level [`Dataset.to_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset) method, or we can use [`Model.prepare_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset).

This results in a *huge* speedup - up to 100X! The downside of XLA generation, though, is that it doesn't like variable input shapes, because it needs to run a new compilation for each new input shape! To compensate for that, let's use `pad_to_multiple_of` for the dataset we use for text generation. This will reduce the number of unique input shapes a lot, meaning we can get the benefits of XLA generation with only a few compilations."
